Features

Smooth color/style transition on scroll

Hover effects for better user interaction

Built using HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity

How It Works

HTML defines the structure of the navigation bar and menu items.

CSS is used to style the navbar, handle hover effects, and create transition effects.

JavaScript detects when the user scrolls and changes the menu style dynamically.
